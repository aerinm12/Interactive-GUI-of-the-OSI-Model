# Interactive-GUI-of-the-OSI-Model
Open Systems Intercommunication (OSI) GUI Model

I created a Java GUI application built using the Swing framework. It demonstrates my strong understanding of event-driven programming, component-based architecture, and best OOP practices. 

The interface is structured using custom panels (labelPanel, buttonPanel, and descriptionPanel), all managed within a main JFrame. Core libraries used include javax.swing for UI components like JButton, JLabel, and JPanel, as well as java.awt and java.awt.event for layout management and action handling. Buttons in the interface dynamically update labels and descriptions, showcasing use of ActionListener and clean data flow between classes. 

Each class handles a specific part of the interface, and I connected them using public methods to maintain modularity and clear data flow. This project helped me deepen my experience with Java Swing and taught me how to design scalable, interactive desktop applications with well-structured code.
